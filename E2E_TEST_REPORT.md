## Issues Encountered

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Chrome Session Creation Error | `SessionNotCreatedException: session not created: probably user data directory is already in use, please specify a unique value for --user-data-dir argument, or don't use --user-data-dir` | This is a common issue with Laravel Dusk in CI environments. The Chrome browser instance couldn't be created properly. This can be resolved by modifying the `DuskTestCase.php` file to use a unique user data directory for each test run or by ensuring all Chrome processes are terminated before running tests. |

## Recommendations

- Modify the `DuskTestCase.php` file to use a unique user data directory for each test run
- Ensure all Chrome processes are terminated before running tests
- Consider using a CI-specific configuration for Dusk tests
- Add proper cleanup of browser processes after tests
- Implement more robust error handling for browser session creation

## Conclusion

The end-to-end tests have been implemented for all core user flows in the LGBE2 application, but they are currently failing due to Chrome session creation issues. These issues are common in CI environments and can be resolved with proper configuration. The test implementation follows best practices with Page Objects for better maintainability and includes comprehensive assertions to verify the functionality of each user flow.

Once the Chrome session issues are resolved, these tests will provide valuable automated verification of the application's core functionality, ensuring that users can successfully navigate the home page, register accounts, create posts, vote on content, and participate in discussions through comments.
