# Community View Fix

This fix addresses the blank page issue when clicking 'View Community' button by ensuring the database is properly seeded with community records.

## Steps to reproduce the fix:

1. Run database migrations: php artisan migrate:fresh
2. Seed the database: php artisan db:seed

This will create the necessary community records in the database, allowing the community view page to render properly.
