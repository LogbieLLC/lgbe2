- **Privacy Protection**: Safeguards against doxxing and unauthorized sharing of personal information.
- **Content Moderation**: Balancing freedom of speech with maintaining a safe environment.

These policies help maintain a positive user experience while managing the complexities of a large, user-driven platform.

## Technical Implementation

The platform includes several technical features:

### Score Calculation

The ranking system starts with a score for each submission, which reflects its popularity and adjusts over time:

```
Score = (up_votes - down_votes) * e^(-λ * t)
```

Where:
- `t` is the time elapsed since the submission
- `λ` is a decay constant that controls how quickly scores decrease

### Ranking Process

Submissions are ranked by sorting them according to the following criteria:

1. **Score (Descending)**: Submissions with higher scores rank higher.
2. **Submission Time (Descending)**: If two submissions have the same score, the newer one ranks higher.
3. **Submission ID (Descending)**: If two submissions have the same score and time, the one with the higher ID ranks higher.

This approach ensures a total ordering of submissions, handling all possible ties.

## Authentication System

The platform implements a robust authentication system that balances security with user experience:

- **Password Management**: Simplified requirements to reduce user frustration while maintaining security.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional 2FA with user-friendly recovery options.
- **Biometric Options**: Support for fingerprint or facial recognition where available.

The system addresses common pain points like forgotten passwords and complex requirements while maintaining strong security standards.
