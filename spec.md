App Specification: Social Media Platform (Reddit-like)
Based on the research provided, this specification outlines the design of a social media platform similar to Reddit, leveraging PHP Laravel for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL (or MariaDB) for the database. The app aims to replicate Reddit's core functionalities while addressing user frustrations and incorporating modern features to enhance usability, performance, and security.
1. Overview
The app will be a community-driven platform where users can:

    Create and join communities (akin to subreddits).
    Share content (links, text, images, videos).
    Engage through upvotes, downvotes, and threaded comments.
    Manage profiles with karma scores.
    Moderate communities and receive notifications.

The design prioritizes a seamless user experience, robust performance, and scalability, drawing insights from Reddit’s strengths (e.g., diverse communities, voting system) and weaknesses (e.g., search issues, downtime).
2. Technology Stack

    Backend: PHP Laravel (RESTful API)
    Frontend: Vue.js (Single Page Application with Vue Router and Vuex)
    Database: MySQL (or MariaDB)
    Additional Tools:
        Laravel Sanctum: API authentication
        Laravel Echo + Pusher: Real-time notifications
        Redis/Memcached: Caching for performance
        Elasticsearch (optional): Enhanced search functionality

3. Key Features and Implementation
3.1 User Authentication and Management
Functionality

    Register, log in, and manage profiles.
    Password reset with email verification.
    Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) with user-friendly recovery options.

Implementation

    Backend (Laravel):
        Use Laravel’s built-in authentication system with Sanctum for API tokens.
        Implement password reset via email.
        Optional 2FA using a package like laravel-two-factor-authentication, with backup codes to mitigate lost-device issues.
    Frontend (Vue.js):
        Components for registration, login, and profile editing.
        Vuex for session state management.
    Database (MySQL):
        users table: id, username, email, password_hash, karma, created_at, updated_at.

Addressing Frustrations

    Simplify password requirements (e.g., minimum length, no forced special characters).
    Provide backup codes for 2FA to reduce lockout risks.

3.2 Communities
Functionality

    Create, join, and manage communities.
    Each community has rules, moderators, and content.

Implementation

    Backend (Laravel):
        communities model and controller.

    Frontend (Vue.js):
        Components for creating, listing, and joining communities.
        Vue Router for community-specific pages (e.g., /c/community-name).
    Database (MySQL):
        communities table: id, name, description, rules, created_at.
        Pivot tables:
            community_user: user_id, community_id, role (member/moderator).

3.3 Content Submission and Interaction
Functionality

    Comment on posts with threaded replies.

Implementation

    Backend (Laravel):
        Models: posts, comments, votes.
        Voting logic: score = (up_votes - down_votes) * e^(-λ * t), where t is time elapsed (in days) and λ (e.g., 0.1) controls decay.
        Relationships: posts to comments, votes to posts/comments.
    Frontend (Vue.js):
        Components for submitting content, voting, and commenting.
        Infinite scrolling for posts/comments.
    Database (MySQL):
        posts table: id, title, content, type (link/text/image/video), community_id, user_id, created_at.
        comments table: id, content, post_id, parent_comment_id, user_id, created_at.
        votes table: id, user_id, votable_id, votable_type (post/comment), vote_type (up/down).

Ranking Process

    Sort by:
        Score (descending).
        Submission time (descending).
        Post/comment ID (descending) for tie-breakers.

3.4 Search Functionality
Functionality

Addressing Frustrations

    Improve relevance over Reddit’s boolean search with natural language processing (via Elasticsearch).
    Minimize server overload with caching.

3.5 User Profiles and Karma
Functionality

    Karma based on net votes (upvotes - downvotes).

Implementation

    Backend (Laravel):
        Extend users model with karma calculation.
        Profile controller to fetch user data.
    Frontend (Vue.js):
        Profile page component showing activity and karma.

    Frontend (Vue.js):
        Notification dropdown with Vuex state management.
    Database (MySQL):
        notifications table: id, user_id, type, data, read_at, created_at.

3.8 Performance and Scalability
Functionality

    Handle large user bases and content efficiently.

Implementation

    Backend (Laravel):
        Cache frequent queries (e.g., top posts) with Redis.
